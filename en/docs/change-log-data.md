# Change Log - Data

The aggregated raw data is available in the GitHub repository [CodeListHub.Data](https://github.com/openpotato/codelisthub.data). The detailed [Commit history](https://github.com/openpotato/codelisthub.data/commits/develop/) can be viewed there. This change log serves as a summarised overview of the changes.

We largely adhere to the recommendations from the community project [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com). However, the code lists in CodeListHub as a whole are not subject to semantic versioning; instead, each code list is versioned individually.
