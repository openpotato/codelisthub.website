# Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)

What does all this OpenStuff mean? Is CodeListHub really Open Data? Can I upload my own code lists? In our FAQ, you'll find answers to the most commonly asked questions about the CodeListHub project.

## Folks, what is CodeListHub again?

CodeListHub is a central place for code lists. The best way to get a feel for the type of data we're talking about is to take a look at the [CodeListHub Explorer](https://explorer.codelisthub.org/en).

## And what is OpenCodeList again?

[OpenCodeList](https://openpotato.github.io/opencodelist/en/) is a standardized JSON format for code lists. So: CodeListHub is an online service, and OpenCodeList is a data format.

And how do they relate to each other? Well, CodeListHub provides you with code lists in the OpenCodeList format.

## Can I use CodeListHub for free?

Yes, the CodeListHub project is Open Data, and the use of the code lists and the API is free and allowed for commercial projects as well. All data comes from public sources. The processed data is licensed under the [ODC Open Database License (ODbL)](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/openpotato/codelisthub.data/refs/heads/main/LICENSE).

## Where is CodeListHub hosted?

The CodeListHub API and the CodeListHub Explorer both run on a Linux server operated by the German internet service provider [STRATO](https://www.strato.de/). The data centre is located in Germany.

## Where does the data come from?

All data for the CodeListHub project comes from public sources (e.g. international code lists like ISO 3166, or standardisation procedures like OpenT8). The origins and sources of the data are generally documented in the OpenCodeList documents of the respective code lists.

## Can I upload my own code lists...?

Basically yes, CodeListHub is open to everyone. Technically, you just need to upload your code lists via a [Pull Request on GitHub](https://github.com/openpotato/codelisthub.data/pulls) to the [data repository](https://github.com/openpotato/codelisthub.data) of CodeListHub.

But (it's never without a "but"): Before you go to the effort, please contact us first, as we want to clarify whether your code lists meet a certain level of maturity or standardisation. Official code lists from authorities (e.g. statistical offices of federal states), established organisations, or software applications are naturally ideal.
